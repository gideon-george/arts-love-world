<p>This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected, 
used, and shared when you visit or make a purchase from www.artsloveworld.com</p>


<h4 class="title">PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h4>

<p>When you visit the Site, we automatically collect certain information about your device, 
including information about your web browser, IP address, time zone, and some of the cookies 
that are installed on your device. Additionally, as you browse the Site, we collect 
information about the individual web pages or products that you view, what websites 
or search terms referred you to the Site, and information about how you interact 
with the Site. We refer to this automatically-collected information as “Device Information.”</p>

<strong>We collect Device Information using the following technologies:</strong>

    
    <p>- “Log files” track actions occurring on the Site, and collect data including 
          your IP address, browser type, Internet service provider, referring/exit pages, 
         and date/time stamps.</p>

    <p>- “Web beacons,” “tags,” and “pixels” are electronic files used to record 
         information about how you browse the Site.</p>

<p>Additionally when you make a purchase or attempt to make a purchase through the Site, 
we collect certain information from you, including your name, billing address, shipping address, 
payment information, email address, and phone number.  We refer to this information as “Order Information.”</p>


<p>When we talk about “Personal Information” in this Privacy Policy, we are talking both 
about Device Information and Order Information.</p>

 <strong>Additionally, we use this Order Information to:</strong>
<p>Communicate with you;</p>
<p>Screen our orders for potential risk or fraud; and</p>
<p>When in line with the preferences you have shared with us, provide you with information or advertising 
relating to our products or services.</p>

<p>We use the Device Information that we collect to help us screen for potential risk and fraud 
(in particular, your IP address), and more generally to improve and optimize our Site 
(for example, by generating analytics about how our customers browse and interact with the Site, 
and to assess the success of our marketing and advertising campaigns).



<h4 class="title">SHARING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h4>

more about how Google uses your Personal Information here:  https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/. </p>

<p>Finally, we may also share your Personal Information to comply with applicable laws and regulations, 
to respond to a subpoena, search warrant or other lawful request for information we receive, or to 
otherwise protect our rights.</p>

<p>Please note that we do not alter our Site’s data collection and use 
practices when we see a Do Not Track signal from your browser.</p>
